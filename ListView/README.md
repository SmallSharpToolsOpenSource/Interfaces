ListView

Sample project which uses a UICollectionView with a horizontal flow layout to implement what is often done by rotating a UITableView to achieve horizontal scrolling. Using UICollectionView is surprisingly easy.

The app has 2 UICollectionView instances which scroll horizontally much like a UITableView does vertically. A layout like this is seen in a lot of places like the iBooks and App Store app. 

A common UI which is sometimes hard to create is the App Store search results whichs how apps lined up in a row with a part of the other apps showing on the left and right side of the app which is in the middle. Normally this would be done with a UIScrollView with paging enabled but that would not allow for partially showing the other cells on the left and right. With a UICollectionView it is fairly easy to assemble this UI as shown in the second instance of the UICollectionView in this app.
